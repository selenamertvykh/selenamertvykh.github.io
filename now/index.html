Looking at that timestamped chart, I wondered about the spike in home-run hitting in the 1880s. It turns out that that was the <a href=https://tht.fangraphs.com/lessons-from-lakefront-park-1884/>1884 Chicago White Stockings</a>, who had approximately the smallest outfield ever (the left-field pole was closer than 200 feet.) Fuck, I love baseball. It&rsquo;s like a microcosm of how ridiculous humanity is.</p><p><strong>31 May</strong>: I finished <em>Play It as It Lays</em> by Joan Didion. I&rsquo;m probably too young to be capable of experiencing it as it was experienced when it came out, but it was a compelling read nevertheless. I found the descriptions of under-the-table abortions especially chilling in the current political climate. I also came away with a distinct appreciation for being properly medicated. Living in the 2020s does have some perks.</p><p><strong>30 May</strong>: I found <a href=https://matduggan.com/programming-in-the/>Programming in the Apocalypse</a> to be a breath of fresh air. It&rsquo;s fun to dream of a world in which the Web doesn&rsquo;t permeate every corner of our lives quite like it does, in which <a href=https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about.html>solar-powered websites</a> are commonplace, and perhaps in which walled gardens do not have me and my friends by the throat. It&rsquo;s also reassuring to know that I can hope for steady work maintaining old systems. Writing C in 2050 sounds like fun. Writing Rust in 2050 sounds more fun.</p><p><strong>29 May</strong>: I registered and deployed this website.</p></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>Â© 2022 Powered by <a href=http://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></span>
