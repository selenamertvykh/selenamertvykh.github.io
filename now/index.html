I&rsquo;ve seen the same threads in others' writing as well. An interesting problem to have, for sure.</li><li>Posts on elegance in text editing: <a href=http://akkartik.name/lines.html>One</a>. <a href=https://texteditors.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?Twee_Editors>Two</a>. Akkartik&rsquo;s blog in particular is really pretty.</li><li><a href=https://applied-langua.ge/posts/>Applied Language</a> is the post-collapse, anarchist tech blog I didn&rsquo;t know I needed. Plus they cite <a href=https://nyxus.xyz/>Nyx Land</a>, who largely started me down the road I&rsquo;ve found myself on.</li><li><a href=https://openai.com/blog/>I didn&rsquo;t realize that That One AI Company had a blog.</a> While I still hew jealously to my opinions on AI and state, it&rsquo;s a breath of fresh air to see people with actual degrees working on the Eliezer shtick.</li><li>Speaking of LessWrongers, <a href=http://zhd.dev/>Zac Hatfield-Dodds</a> has a blog. &ldquo;Interpretable AI&rdquo; is possibly the best you can do in the area of AI safety, besides possibly &ldquo;no AI at all.&rdquo;</li><li>Out of post-workout curiosity the other day I started wondering what was up with the really light radioelements (technetium and promethium.) This led me to the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattauch_isobar_rule>Mattauch isobar rule</a>, which is just chef&rsquo;s kiss levels of elegant. Relatedly, I also got my hands on a copy of <a href=https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780750633659/chemistry-of-the-elements>Chemistry of the Elements</a>, which makes my brain produce the Good Chemicals in abundance. It&rsquo;s like a tome that contains all of my childhood wonder at the periodic table.</li><li><a href=https://sourceless.org/posts/relearning-to-learn.html>Laurence Pakenham-Smith</a> has a pretty neat blog.</li><li><a href=https://theoryof.predictable.software/articles/a-closer-look-at-cvss-scores/>I understand none of this but it looks cool.</a></li></ol><p><strong>14 June</strong>: I discovered today that my morning cup of coffee was suffering because I was using water from a refrigerated Brita filter rather than water from the tap. <a href=https://prima-coffee.com/blog/article/experimenting-bonavita-brewing-temperatures/30961>A Prima Coffee article</a> confirmed my suspicions.</p><p><strong>13 June</strong>: I found out that <a href=https://www.billjamesonline.com/_putting_synthetic_statcast_numbers_on_top_minor_league_sluggers/>Bill James has a blog</a>.</p><p><strong>4 June</strong>: <a href=https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YgvAXTnaapknGhPvt/the-burden-of-worldbuilding>Some cool thoughts on systems of measure and worldbuilding more generally</a> over on LessWrong. I love reading about things like this. See also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfdeWd0RMk">jan Misali telling a very long and elaborate joke about measurement.</a></p><p><strong>3 June</strong>: A couple of interesting posts on Rust today:</p><ol><li><a href=https://hirrolot.github.io/posts/rust-is-hard-or-the-misery-of-mainstream-programming.html>Rust is Hard, or the Misery of Mainstream Programming</a></li><li><a href=https://itsallaboutthebit.com/async-simple/>(async) Rust doesn&rsquo;t have to be hard</a></li></ol><p>My Rust knowledge isn&rsquo;t where I&rsquo;d like it to be, so these are mainly just bookmarks for later.</p><p>And a <a href=https://michaelnotebook.com/eanotes/>balanced take on effective altruism</a> from Michael Nielsen. EA bothers me for a few reasons, but mainly I feel I have <a href=/posts/weapon/>more urgent things to do with my time</a>. I also have <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/transtrans/comments/v057uf/what_do_you_people_think/ib30u9t/>some philosophical issues</a> with the AI safety folks. I&rsquo;m interested in writing more about my experience with LessWrong and rationalism in general in the near future.</p><p><strong>1 June</strong>: I was watching the <a href="https://youtu.be/e6AI_FJWZPY?t=538">Mariners documentary</a> again. Looking at that timestamped chart, I wondered about the spike in home-run hitting in the 1880s. It turns out that that was the <a href=https://tht.fangraphs.com/lessons-from-lakefront-park-1884/>1884 Chicago White Stockings</a>, who had approximately the smallest outfield ever (the left-field pole was closer than 200 feet.) Fuck, I love baseball. It&rsquo;s like a microcosm of how ridiculous humanity is.</p><p><strong>31 May</strong>: I finished <em>Play It as It Lays</em> by Joan Didion. I&rsquo;m probably too young to be capable of experiencing it as it was experienced when it came out, but it was a compelling read nevertheless. I found the descriptions of under-the-table abortions especially chilling in the current political climate. I also came away with a distinct appreciation for being properly medicated. Living in the 2020s does have some perks.</p><p><strong>30 May</strong>: I found <a href=https://matduggan.com/programming-in-the/>Programming in the Apocalypse</a> to be a breath of fresh air. It&rsquo;s fun to dream of a world in which the Web doesn&rsquo;t permeate every corner of our lives quite like it does, in which <a href=https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about.html>solar-powered websites</a> are commonplace, and perhaps in which walled gardens do not have me and my friends by the throat. It&rsquo;s also reassuring to know that I can hope for steady work maintaining old systems. Writing C in 2050 sounds like fun. Writing Rust in 2050 sounds more fun.</p><p><strong>29 May</strong>: I registered and deployed this website.</p></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>Â© 2022 Powered by <a href=http://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></span>
