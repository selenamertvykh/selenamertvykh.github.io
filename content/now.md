# 2022

**1 June**: I was watching the [Mariners documentary](https://youtu.be/e6AI_FJWZPY?t=538) again. Looking at that timestamped chart, I wondered about the spike in home-run hitting in the 1880s. It turns out that that was the [1884 Chicago White Stockings](https://tht.fangraphs.com/lessons-from-lakefront-park-1884/), who had approximately the smallest outfield ever (the left-field pole was closer than 200 feet.) Fuck, I love baseball. It's like a microcosm of how ridiculous humanity is.

**31 May**: I finished *Play It as It Lays* by Joan Didion. I'm probably too young to be capable of experiencing it as it was experienced when it came out, but it was a compelling read nevertheless. I found the descriptions of under-the-table abortions especially chilling in the current political climate. I also came away with a distinct appreciation for being properly medicated. Living in the 2020s does have some perks.

**30 May**: I found [Programming in the Apocalypse](https://matduggan.com/programming-in-the/) to be a breath of fresh air. It's fun to dream of a world in which the Web doesn't permeate every corner of our lives quite like it does, in which [solar-powered websites](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about.html) are commonplace, and perhaps in which walled gardens do not have me and my friends by the throat. It's also reassuring to know that I can hope for steady work maintaining old systems. Writing C in 2050 sounds like fun. Writing Rust in 2050 sounds more fun.

**29 May**: I registered and deployed this website.
