# 2022

**23 June**: Tab roundup from this week --- most of these are from HN but whatever:

1. [Here is a pretty well-written gears model of some things I've suffered from.](https://old.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1zyiob/literally_too_lazy_to_live_part_2/) [Here's some ideas for tackling them.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ResponsibleRecovery/comments/e6mjk3/a_summary_of_recovery_activities/) Beware the usual Reddit chuds.
2. [Here is a PL expert talking about Lisp.](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/) This makes the part of me that needs to get around to reading the rest of SICP very excited.
3. [List of drone/progressive electronic music.](https://rateyourmusic.com/list/Phimister/music_that_can_swallow_all_misery_whole__drone/) I originally bookmarked this for psychedelic treatments, but it hits a lot of the same points as [Zimina's list](https://rateyourmusic.com/list/Lamuya/ambient-and-atmospheric-recommendations/), which has been a great waypoint for getting into onkyo/EAI.
4. [A HN discussion about technical writing.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31630915) I'm looking for styles to crib from that hit the sweet spot between elegant and polite; I often feel that my own style a bit too condescending. I've seen the same threads in others' writing as well. An interesting problem to have, for sure.
5. Posts on elegance in text editing: [One](http://akkartik.name/lines.html). [Two](https://texteditors.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?Twee_Editors). Akkartik's blog in particular is really pretty.
6. [Applied Language](https://applied-langua.ge/posts/) is the post-collapse, anarchist tech blog I didn't know I needed. Plus they cite [Nyx Land](https://nyxus.xyz/), who largely started me down the road I've found myself on.
7. [I didn't realize that That One AI Company had a blog.](https://openai.com/blog/) While I still hew jealously to my opinions on AI and state, it's a breath of fresh air to see people with actual degrees working on the Eliezer shtick.
8. Speaking of LessWrongers, [Zac Hatfield-Dodds](http://zhd.dev/) has a blog. "Interpretable AI" is possibly the best you can do in the area of AI safety, besides possibly "no AI at all."
9. Out of post-workout curiosity the other day I started wondering what was up with the really light radioelements (technetium and promethium.) This led me to the [Mattauch isobar rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattauch_isobar_rule), which is just chef's kiss levels of elegant. Relatedly, I also got my hands on a copy of [Chemistry of the Elements](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780750633659/chemistry-of-the-elements), which makes my brain produce the Good Chemicals in abundance. It's like a tome that contains all of my childhood wonder at the periodic table.
10. [Laurence Pakenham-Smith](https://sourceless.org/posts/relearning-to-learn.html) has a pretty neat blog.
11. [I understand none of this but it looks cool.](https://theoryof.predictable.software/articles/a-closer-look-at-cvss-scores/)

**14 June**: I discovered today that my morning cup of coffee was suffering because I was using water from a refrigerated Brita filter rather than water from the tap. [A Prima Coffee article](https://prima-coffee.com/blog/article/experimenting-bonavita-brewing-temperatures/30961) confirmed my suspicions.

**13 June**: I found out that [Bill James has a blog](https://www.billjamesonline.com/_putting_synthetic_statcast_numbers_on_top_minor_league_sluggers/).

**4 June**: [Some cool thoughts on systems of measure and worldbuilding more generally](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YgvAXTnaapknGhPvt/the-burden-of-worldbuilding) over on LessWrong. I love reading about things like this. See also [jan Misali telling a very long and elaborate joke about measurement.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfdeWd0RMk)

**3 June**: A couple of interesting posts on Rust today:

1. [Rust is Hard, or the Misery of Mainstream Programming](https://hirrolot.github.io/posts/rust-is-hard-or-the-misery-of-mainstream-programming.html)
2. [(async) Rust doesn't have to be hard](https://itsallaboutthebit.com/async-simple/)

My Rust knowledge isn't where I'd like it to be, so these are mainly just bookmarks for later.

And a [balanced take on effective altruism](https://michaelnotebook.com/eanotes/) from Michael Nielsen. EA bothers me for a few reasons, but mainly I feel I have [more urgent things to do with my time](/posts/weapon/). I also have [some philosophical issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/transtrans/comments/v057uf/what_do_you_people_think/ib30u9t/) with the AI safety folks. I'm interested in writing more about my experience with LessWrong and rationalism in general in the near future.


**1 June**: I was watching the [Mariners documentary](https://youtu.be/e6AI_FJWZPY?t=538) again. Looking at that timestamped chart, I wondered about the spike in home-run hitting in the 1880s. It turns out that that was the [1884 Chicago White Stockings](https://tht.fangraphs.com/lessons-from-lakefront-park-1884/), who had approximately the smallest outfield ever (the left-field pole was closer than 200 feet.) Fuck, I love baseball. It's like a microcosm of how ridiculous humanity is.

**31 May**: I finished *Play It as It Lays* by Joan Didion. I'm probably too young to be capable of experiencing it as it was experienced when it came out, but it was a compelling read nevertheless. I found the descriptions of under-the-table abortions especially chilling in the current political climate. I also came away with a distinct appreciation for being properly medicated. Living in the 2020s does have some perks.

**30 May**: I found [Programming in the Apocalypse](https://matduggan.com/programming-in-the/) to be a breath of fresh air. It's fun to dream of a world in which the Web doesn't permeate every corner of our lives quite like it does, in which [solar-powered websites](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about.html) are commonplace, and perhaps in which walled gardens do not have me and my friends by the throat. It's also reassuring to know that I can hope for steady work maintaining old systems. Writing C in 2050 sounds like fun. Writing Rust in 2050 sounds more fun.

**29 May**: I registered and deployed this website.
