# 2022

**14 June**: I discovered today that my morning cup of coffee was suffering because I was using water from a refrigerated Brita filter rather than water from the tap. [A Prima Coffee article](https://prima-coffee.com/blog/article/experimenting-bonavita-brewing-temperatures/30961) confirmed my suspicions.

**13 June**: I found out that [Bill James has a blog](https://www.billjamesonline.com/_putting_synthetic_statcast_numbers_on_top_minor_league_sluggers/).

**4 June**: [Some cool thoughts on systems of measure and worldbuilding more generally](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YgvAXTnaapknGhPvt/the-burden-of-worldbuilding) over on LessWrong. I love reading about things like this. See also [jan Misali telling a very long and elaborate joke about measurement.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfdeWd0RMk)

**3 June**: A couple of interesting posts on Rust today:

1. [Rust is Hard, or the Misery of Mainstream Programming](https://hirrolot.github.io/posts/rust-is-hard-or-the-misery-of-mainstream-programming.html)
2. [(async) Rust doesn't have to be hard](https://itsallaboutthebit.com/async-simple/)

My Rust knowledge isn't where I'd like it to be, so these are mainly just bookmarks for later.

And a [balanced take on effective altruism](https://michaelnotebook.com/eanotes/) from Michael Nielsen. EA bothers me for a few reasons, but mainly I feel I have [more urgent things to do with my time](/posts/weapon/). I also have [some philosophical issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/transtrans/comments/v057uf/what_do_you_people_think/ib30u9t/) with the AI safety folks. I'm interested in writing more about my experience with LessWrong and rationalism in general in the near future.


**1 June**: I was watching the [Mariners documentary](https://youtu.be/e6AI_FJWZPY?t=538) again. Looking at that timestamped chart, I wondered about the spike in home-run hitting in the 1880s. It turns out that that was the [1884 Chicago White Stockings](https://tht.fangraphs.com/lessons-from-lakefront-park-1884/), who had approximately the smallest outfield ever (the left-field pole was closer than 200 feet.) Fuck, I love baseball. It's like a microcosm of how ridiculous humanity is.

**31 May**: I finished *Play It as It Lays* by Joan Didion. I'm probably too young to be capable of experiencing it as it was experienced when it came out, but it was a compelling read nevertheless. I found the descriptions of under-the-table abortions especially chilling in the current political climate. I also came away with a distinct appreciation for being properly medicated. Living in the 2020s does have some perks.

**30 May**: I found [Programming in the Apocalypse](https://matduggan.com/programming-in-the/) to be a breath of fresh air. It's fun to dream of a world in which the Web doesn't permeate every corner of our lives quite like it does, in which [solar-powered websites](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about.html) are commonplace, and perhaps in which walled gardens do not have me and my friends by the throat. It's also reassuring to know that I can hope for steady work maintaining old systems. Writing C in 2050 sounds like fun. Writing Rust in 2050 sounds more fun.

**29 May**: I registered and deployed this website.
