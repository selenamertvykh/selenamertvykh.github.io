Hello! I'm **Selena,** a very gay former human. My pronouns are *xe/xyr.*

I work as a developer by day. Then I slip out of my human flesh and have depraved ancom postfurry orgies with lots of tentacles, blood, etc.[^1]

[^1]: They're great fun. One day I'll set up a Cicada 3301-styled ARG to find those who want to be like me. We have such sights to show you.

My name is [a pun](https://www.deepl.com/translator#ru/en/%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B0%20%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B2%D1%8B%D1%85) on [a Boards of Canada song about the end of industrial civilization.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3NLHF6oV4Q)[^2]  More optimistically, it evokes an old saying: “A society grows great when old men plant trees in whose shade they shall never sit.”

[^2]: Does this depress you? It doesn't have to. Everything ends.

This site is a clearinghouse for thoughts and opinions on posthumanity, transtrans, and my own peculiar breed of rationalism.

Interested in contacting me? My Discord handle is SelenaMertvykh#N, where N is the number of visually distinct ways to fill a 38-block row with blocks of length 1, 8, and 9.
