Brynn Tannehill was right, although her timeline may have been a little pessimistic. If you&amp;rsquo;re like me at all, a sizable fraction of the population wants you dead, as in lined up and shot. They will unblinkingly accuse your suicide hotlines of being sexual predators. If you&amp;rsquo;re unlucky enough to draw the attention of some of them, they will harass you until you commit die &amp;mdash; dox you, show up outside your house, get you fired from your job &amp;mdash; for the crime of being trans on the internet, because they think it&amp;rsquo;s funny.</description><content>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s morning again in America. We live in the future. &lt;em>O tempora! O mores!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Brynn Tannehill was right, although her timeline may have been a little pessimistic. If you&amp;rsquo;re like me at all, a sizable fraction of the population wants you dead, &lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2022/03/25/mississippi-republican-calls-for-killings-of-trans-people-and-supporters.html">as in lined up and shot.&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://www.losangelesblade.com/2022/04/29/hands-off-trevor-project-suicidal-lgbtq-youth/">They will unblinkingly accuse your suicide hotlines of being sexual predators.&lt;/a> If you&amp;rsquo;re unlucky enough to draw the attention of some of them, they will harass you until you commit die &amp;mdash; dox you, show up outside your house, get you fired from your job &amp;mdash; for the crime of being trans on the internet, because they think it&amp;rsquo;s funny. The cruelty is the fucking point. It&amp;rsquo;s going to get worse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A sizable chunk of the queer community &amp;mdash; in the way that we predominantly relate to each other these days, i.e. social media &amp;mdash; isn&amp;rsquo;t blameless either. Isabel Fall was absolutely right and the chucklefucks who ran her into a mental ward know it.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> If you follow anyone at all in the vague direction of the left you&amp;rsquo;ve heard of something like this happening.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Welcome to the Cool Zone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Being a smartass on Twitter doesn&amp;rsquo;t fix this. Going to a protest with drag shows and people with clever signs doesn&amp;rsquo;t fix this. In this day and age the utility of a response to fascist calls for genocide is apparently measured in the number of white liberals with HRC bumper stickers that it enrages.&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Doomscrolling doesn&amp;rsquo;t fix this either. It&amp;rsquo;s your hindbrain stuck in a feedback loop. It accomplishes very little other than destruction. It destroys your mind, your relationships, and your life, all in the name of ad revenue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There &lt;em>is&lt;/em> a way out. I mentioned Isabel earlier for one very specific reason. Being, as I am, a disgusting freak with disgusting body-horror fetishes, I was both horrified and aroused by Helicopter Story. It was too emotionally powerful for me to revisit for some time. When my rational brain caught up with my emotional one, I realized that I would gladly submit to tactical gender reassignment, as long as I was fighting &lt;em>against&lt;/em> the remains of the US on behalf of a trans paramilitary force or something like that. It&amp;rsquo;s not a question of being a weapon &amp;mdash; that&amp;rsquo;s going to happen one way or the other &amp;mdash; it&amp;rsquo;s a question of who you&amp;rsquo;re pointed at. &lt;a href="https://korpscon.com/">The Korps&lt;/a> explored this concept a couple years before Isabel ever did. M61 Vulcan go spinny.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The way out of the feedback loop is action. Here&amp;rsquo;s what has been the most helpful for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="0">
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Keep your body safe.&lt;/strong>
Most importantly, if you are at risk of self-harm, do whatever you must to ward that off before anything else. The rest of this advice is supposed to double as a mental health prescription, but if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work for you then it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work.
&lt;em>(What follows is my own personal experience. I am a GPT-3 instance with a blog, not your doctor.)&lt;/em>
Having been in those trenches for a long time, I can say that sometimes the usual advice &amp;mdash; have functional coping mechanisms, go to therapy, be social, exercise, eat well, sleep well &amp;mdash; just doesn&amp;rsquo;t always work, whether for neurological or systemic reasons. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s like trying to start a fire with wet wood. You need a spark. Intranasal ketamine has been extremely helpful for me in that capacity. So has psilocybin. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard exciting things about MDMA as well. If you can afford to have any of these administered under controlled clinical settings, and nothing else has worked so far, it&amp;rsquo;s worth a shot. If not, mushrooms are &lt;a href="https://reddit.com/r/unclebens">probably the easiest to source.&lt;/a> Obviously do your research before you ingest any entheogen or dissociative. Don&amp;rsquo;t fly blind.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Keep your identity safe.&lt;/strong>
Back when it happened, I heard someone say, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Atsiko/status/1217691682315100160">&amp;ldquo;Isabel stepped on a landmine.&amp;quot;&lt;/a> This is accurate &amp;mdash; even if I want to scream, &amp;ldquo;who put the fucking landmine there, you fucking dipshits?&amp;rdquo;
Stay out of the minefield. Keep your opsec tight. Do not maintain any more than a cursory social media presence under your real name. Learn &lt;a href="https://open.nytimes.com/how-to-dox-yourself-on-the-internet-d2892b4c5954?gi=2ad9ec15db0d">how to dox yourself&lt;/a> and do it every couple months. A little paranoia goes a long way.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Train like a motherfucker.&lt;/strong>
Lifting and running have been a godsend for me, if only because they give my anger an outlet. &lt;a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/max-res-maximum-potential">There are some who will say that the apparatus of state violence doesn&amp;rsquo;t care how much you deadlift or what your mile time is.&lt;/a> That&amp;rsquo;s true, but the looming threat to your safety in coming years is probably stochastic violence, not out-and-out state violence. Some nutjob with an AR will act long before the government does. Becoming harder to kill is good praxis.
Both volumes of &lt;a href="https://www.tacticalbarbell.com/">Tactical Barbell&lt;/a> are available on libgen. It&amp;rsquo;s simple and easy to remember, and I enjoy it as much as I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed any regimen. If you already lift and have a program you like, far be it from me to tell you what to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Learn to shoot.&lt;/strong> This was something I was afraid of for a long time, owing to the whole suicidally-depressed thing. It helped. If you&amp;rsquo;re in a major urban area there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.pinkpistols.org/find-a-local-chapter/">probably a leftist gun club or Discord near you.&lt;/a> If not, you &lt;a href="https://www.blazingsword.org/">may be able to find a queer-friendly instructor in your area.&lt;/a> Their politics may be too shallow or too statist for you, but it beats nothing. It should also be noted that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to own a gun yet if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to, but a couple of days at the range with a trusted friend is not a bad idea at all.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Read up.&lt;/strong> This need not be a dull affair. For theory, I like the &lt;a href="https://everything2.com/title/Rage+Against+The+Machine%2527s+recommended+reading+list">RATM reading list&lt;/a>. Hell, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a bad idea to start with &lt;a href="https://youtube.com/c/thephilosophytube">Abigail Thorn&lt;/a>, who is very, very good about citing her sources. &lt;a href="https://reddit.com/r/socialistra">r/SocialistRA&lt;/a> has a very nice &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialistRA/wiki/index">wiki&lt;/a> that covers many of the same points as this blog post. Between Libgen and Sci-Hub you should be able to get your hands on anything you need.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Don&amp;rsquo;t die twice.&lt;/strong> You are guaranteed to die once. Do not squelch the life within you for the purpose of your safety; your fear and self-censorship will not protect you. They already know you&amp;rsquo;re trans. They&amp;rsquo;ve already planned your death. You might as well be your entire self, immediate living conditions permitting.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Go forth. Contain multitudes. Tear shit up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Flesh is temporary; the synthetic is eternal.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>23 June&lt;/strong>: Tab roundup from this week &amp;mdash; most of these are from HN but whatever:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1zyiob/literally_too_lazy_to_live_part_2/">Here is a pretty well-written gears model of some things I&amp;rsquo;ve suffered from.&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ResponsibleRecovery/comments/e6mjk3/a_summary_of_recovery_activities/">Here&amp;rsquo;s some ideas for tackling them.&lt;/a> Beware the usual Reddit chuds.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/">Here is a PL expert talking about Lisp.&lt;/a> This makes the part of me that needs to get around to reading the rest of SICP very excited.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/list/Phimister/music_that_can_swallow_all_misery_whole__drone/">List of drone/progressive electronic music.&lt;/a> I originally bookmarked this for psychedelic treatments, but it hits a lot of the same points as &lt;a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/list/Lamuya/ambient-and-atmospheric-recommendations/">Zimina&amp;rsquo;s list&lt;/a>, which has been a great waypoint for getting into onkyo/EAI.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31630915">A HN discussion about technical writing.&lt;/a> I&amp;rsquo;m looking for styles to crib from that hit the sweet spot between elegant and polite; I often feel that my own style a bit too condescending. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen the same threads in others' writing as well. An interesting problem to have, for sure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Posts on elegance in text editing: &lt;a href="http://akkartik.name/lines.html">One&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="https://texteditors.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?Twee_Editors">Two&lt;/a>. Akkartik&amp;rsquo;s blog in particular is really pretty.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://applied-langua.ge/posts/">Applied Language&lt;/a> is the post-collapse, anarchist tech blog I didn&amp;rsquo;t know I needed. Plus they cite &lt;a href="https://nyxus.xyz/">Nyx Land&lt;/a>, who largely started me down the road I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself on.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://openai.com/blog/">I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize that That One AI Company had a blog.&lt;/a> While I still hew jealously to my opinions on AI and state, it&amp;rsquo;s a breath of fresh air to see people with actual degrees working on the Eliezer shtick.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Speaking of LessWrongers, &lt;a href="http://zhd.dev/">Zac Hatfield-Dodds&lt;/a> has a blog. &amp;ldquo;Interpretable AI&amp;rdquo; is possibly the best you can do in the area of AI safety, besides possibly &amp;ldquo;no AI at all.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Out of post-workout curiosity the other day I started wondering what was up with the really light radioelements (technetium and promethium.) This led me to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattauch_isobar_rule">Mattauch isobar rule&lt;/a>, which is just chef&amp;rsquo;s kiss levels of elegant. Relatedly, I also got my hands on a copy of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780750633659/chemistry-of-the-elements">Chemistry of the Elements&lt;/a>, which makes my brain produce the Good Chemicals in abundance. It&amp;rsquo;s like a tome that contains all of my childhood wonder at the periodic table.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://sourceless.org/posts/relearning-to-learn.html">Laurence Pakenham-Smith&lt;/a> has a pretty neat blog.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://theoryof.predictable.software/articles/a-closer-look-at-cvss-scores/">I understand none of this but it looks cool.&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>14 June&lt;/strong>: I discovered today that my morning cup of coffee was suffering because I was using water from a refrigerated Brita filter rather than water from the tap. &lt;a href="https://prima-coffee.com/blog/article/experimenting-bonavita-brewing-temperatures/30961">A Prima Coffee article&lt;/a> confirmed my suspicions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>13 June&lt;/strong>: I found out that &lt;a href="https://www.billjamesonline.com/_putting_synthetic_statcast_numbers_on_top_minor_league_sluggers/">Bill James has a blog&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>4 June&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YgvAXTnaapknGhPvt/the-burden-of-worldbuilding">Some cool thoughts on systems of measure and worldbuilding more generally&lt;/a> over on LessWrong. I love reading about things like this. See also &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfdeWd0RMk">jan Misali telling a very long and elaborate joke about measurement.&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>3 June&lt;/strong>: A couple of interesting posts on Rust today:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://hirrolot.github.io/posts/rust-is-hard-or-the-misery-of-mainstream-programming.html">Rust is Hard, or the Misery of Mainstream Programming&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://itsallaboutthebit.com/async-simple/">(async) Rust doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be hard&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>My Rust knowledge isn&amp;rsquo;t where I&amp;rsquo;d like it to be, so these are mainly just bookmarks for later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And a &lt;a href="https://michaelnotebook.com/eanotes/">balanced take on effective altruism&lt;/a> from Michael Nielsen. EA bothers me for a few reasons, but mainly I feel I have &lt;a href="https://mertvykh.gay/posts/weapon/">more urgent things to do with my time&lt;/a>. I also have &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/transtrans/comments/v057uf/what_do_you_people_think/ib30u9t/">some philosophical issues&lt;/a> with the AI safety folks. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in writing more about my experience with LessWrong and rationalism in general in the near future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>1 June&lt;/strong>: I was watching the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/e6AI_FJWZPY?t=538">Mariners documentary&lt;/a> again. Looking at that timestamped chart, I wondered about the spike in home-run hitting in the 1880s. It turns out that that was the &lt;a href="https://tht.fangraphs.com/lessons-from-lakefront-park-1884/">1884 Chicago White Stockings&lt;/a>, who had approximately the smallest outfield ever (the left-field pole was closer than 200 feet.) Fuck, I love baseball. It&amp;rsquo;s like a microcosm of how ridiculous humanity is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>31 May&lt;/strong>: I finished &lt;em>Play It as It Lays&lt;/em> by Joan Didion. I&amp;rsquo;m probably too young to be capable of experiencing it as it was experienced when it came out, but it was a compelling read nevertheless. I found the descriptions of under-the-table abortions especially chilling in the current political climate. I also came away with a distinct appreciation for being properly medicated. Living in the 2020s does have some perks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>30 May&lt;/strong>: I found &lt;a href="https://matduggan.com/programming-in-the/">Programming in the Apocalypse&lt;/a> to be a breath of fresh air. It&amp;rsquo;s fun to dream of a world in which the Web doesn&amp;rsquo;t permeate every corner of our lives quite like it does, in which &lt;a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about.html">solar-powered websites&lt;/a> are commonplace, and perhaps in which walled gardens do not have me and my friends by the throat. It&amp;rsquo;s also reassuring to know that I can hope for steady work maintaining old systems. Writing C in 2050 sounds like fun. Writing Rust in 2050 sounds more fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>29 May&lt;/strong>: I registered and deployed this website.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
