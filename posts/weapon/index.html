We live in the future. <em>O tempora! O mores!</em></p><p>Brynn Tannehill was right, although her timeline may have been a little pessimistic. If you&rsquo;re like me at all, a sizable fraction of the population wants you dead, <a href=https://boingboing.net/2022/03/25/mississippi-republican-calls-for-killings-of-trans-people-and-supporters.html>as in lined up and shot.</a> <a href=https://www.losangelesblade.com/2022/04/29/hands-off-trevor-project-suicidal-lgbtq-youth/>They will unblinkingly accuse your suicide hotlines of being sexual predators.</a> If you&rsquo;re unlucky enough to draw the attention of some of them, they will harass you until you commit die &mdash; dox you, show up outside your house, get you fired from your job &mdash; for the crime of being trans on the internet, because they think it&rsquo;s funny. The cruelty is the fucking point. It&rsquo;s going to get worse.</p><p>A sizable chunk of the queer community &mdash; in the way that we predominantly relate to each other these days, i.e. social media &mdash; isn&rsquo;t blameless either. Isabel Fall was absolutely right and the chucklefucks who ran her into a mental ward know it.<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> If you follow anyone at all in the vague direction of the left you&rsquo;ve heard of something like this happening.</p><p>Welcome to the Cool Zone.</p><p>Being a smartass on Twitter doesn&rsquo;t fix this. Going to a protest with drag shows and people with clever signs doesn&rsquo;t fix this. In this day and age the utility of a response to fascist calls for genocide is apparently measured in the number of white liberals with HRC bumper stickers that it enrages.<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup></p><p>Doomscrolling doesn&rsquo;t fix this either. It&rsquo;s your hindbrain stuck in a feedback loop. It accomplishes very little other than destruction. It destroys your mind, your relationships, and your life, all in the name of ad revenue.</p><p>There <em>is</em> a way out. I mentioned Isabel earlier for one very specific reason. Being, as I am, a disgusting freak with disgusting body-horror fetishes, I was both horrified and aroused by Helicopter Story. It was too emotionally powerful for me to revisit for some time. When my rational brain caught up with my emotional one, I realized that I would gladly submit to tactical gender reassignment, as long as I was fighting <em>against</em> the remains of the US on behalf of a trans paramilitary force or something like that. It&rsquo;s not a question of being a weapon &mdash; that&rsquo;s going to happen one way or the other &mdash; it&rsquo;s a question of who you&rsquo;re pointed at. <a href=https://korpscon.com/>The Korps</a> explored this concept a couple years before Isabel ever did. M61 Vulcan go spinny.</p><p>The way out of the feedback loop is action. Here&rsquo;s what has been the most helpful for me.</p><ol start=0><li><p><strong>Keep your body safe.</strong>
Most importantly, if you are at risk of self-harm, do whatever you must to ward that off before anything else. The rest of this advice is supposed to double as a mental health prescription, but if it doesn&rsquo;t work for you then it doesn&rsquo;t work.
<em>(What follows is my own personal experience. I am a GPT-3 instance with a blog, not your doctor.)</em>
Having been in those trenches for a long time, I can say that sometimes the usual advice &mdash; have functional coping mechanisms, go to therapy, be social, exercise, eat well, sleep well &mdash; just doesn&rsquo;t always work, whether for neurological or systemic reasons. Sometimes it&rsquo;s like trying to start a fire with wet wood. You need a spark. Intranasal ketamine has been extremely helpful for me in that capacity. So has psilocybin. I&rsquo;ve heard exciting things about MDMA as well. If you can afford to have any of these administered under controlled clinical settings, and nothing else has worked so far, it&rsquo;s worth a shot. If not, mushrooms are <a href=https://reddit.com/r/unclebens>probably the easiest to source.</a> Obviously do your research before you ingest any entheogen or dissociative. Don&rsquo;t fly blind.</p></li><li><p><strong>Keep your identity safe.</strong>
Back when it happened, I heard someone say, <a href=https://twitter.com/Atsiko/status/1217691682315100160>&ldquo;Isabel stepped on a landmine."</a> This is accurate &mdash; even if I want to scream, &ldquo;who put the fucking landmine there, you fucking dipshits?&rdquo;
Stay out of the minefield. Keep your opsec tight. Do not maintain any more than a cursory social media presence under your real name. Learn <a href="https://open.nytimes.com/how-to-dox-yourself-on-the-internet-d2892b4c5954?gi=2ad9ec15db0d">how to dox yourself</a> and do it every couple months. A little paranoia goes a long way.</p></li><li><p><strong>Train like a motherfucker.</strong>
Lifting and running have been a godsend for me, if only because they give my anger an outlet. <a href=https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/max-res-maximum-potential>There are some who will say that the apparatus of state violence doesn&rsquo;t care how much you deadlift or what your mile time is.</a> That&rsquo;s true, but the looming threat to your safety in coming years is probably stochastic violence, not out-and-out state violence. Some nutjob with an AR will act long before the government does. Becoming harder to kill is good praxis.
Both volumes of <a href=https://www.tacticalbarbell.com/>Tactical Barbell</a> are available on libgen. It&rsquo;s simple and easy to remember, and I enjoy it as much as I&rsquo;ve enjoyed any regimen. If you already lift and have a program you like, far be it from me to tell you what to do.</p></li><li><p><strong>Learn to shoot.</strong> This was something I was afraid of for a long time, owing to the whole suicidally-depressed thing. It helped. If you&rsquo;re in a major urban area there&rsquo;s <a href=https://www.pinkpistols.org/find-a-local-chapter/>probably a leftist gun club or Discord near you.</a> If not, you <a href=https://www.blazingsword.org/>may be able to find a queer-friendly instructor in your area.</a> Their politics may be too shallow or too statist for you, but it beats nothing. It should also be noted that you don&rsquo;t need to own a gun yet if you don&rsquo;t want to, but a couple of days at the range with a trusted friend is not a bad idea at all.</p></li><li><p><strong>Read up.</strong> This need not be a dull affair. For theory, I like the <a href=https://everything2.com/title/Rage+Against+The+Machine%2527s+recommended+reading+list>RATM reading list</a>. Hell, it wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad idea to start with <a href=https://youtube.com/c/thephilosophytube>Abigail Thorn</a>, who is very, very good about citing her sources. <a href=https://reddit.com/r/socialistra>r/SocialistRA</a> has a very nice <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialistRA/wiki/index>wiki</a> that covers many of the same points as this blog post. Between Libgen and Sci-Hub you should be able to get your hands on anything you need.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t die twice.</strong> You are guaranteed to die once. Do not squelch the life within you for the purpose of your safety; your fear and self-censorship will not protect you. They already know you&rsquo;re trans. They&rsquo;ve already planned your death. You might as well be your entire self, immediate living conditions permitting.</p></li></ol><p>Go forth. Contain multitudes.
